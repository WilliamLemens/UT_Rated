### Update: Abandon ship... ish.
I reached out to the CIS team about querying their database and recieved the following email:

> I’m glad you decided to inquire further about this prior to taking action, for what you propose is against university policy per UT’s Information Security Office (ISO). Please refer to ISO policy 5.7, pasted below for your convenience:

	 > 5.7 Use resources appropriately. Do not interfere with the activities of others or use a disproportionate share of information resources. Examples of inappropriate use of resources are shown below. These actions frequently result in complaints and subsequent disciplinary action.
	 - > Sending an unsolicited message(s) to a large number of recipients (known as "spamming the network").
	 - > Consuming an unauthorized disproportionate share of networking resources (e.g., misuse of peer-to-peer applications).
	 - > Deliberately causing any denial of service, including flooding, ICMP attacks, or the unauthorized automated use of a service intended solely for human interaction.
> While I believe that you have no malicious intent, please be advised that there are serious consequences for what you propose and thus you are directed to use the CIS Results Site as intended/currently authorized to you via the following interface:   https://utdirect.utexas.edu/ctl/ecis/results/index.WBX

As such I'm going to simply make this extension add links to relevant CIS resources for teachers, rather than pulling data from their site to display in the page. Not ideal by any means, but hopefully still helpful.

Furthermore, I don't think I can force links to classes, so RIP that functionality too.

# UT Rated
Most of us UT students spend a lot of time switching back and forth between [RateMyProfessor](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1255) and the [course schedules](https://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules).

Wouldn't it be grand if you could see RateMyProfessor's info right on the schedule?

Well I can do you one better. UT's been posting the [data from their Course Instructor Surveys](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/ctl/ecis/results/index.WBX) for years now, and those are way more useful. Less memes and more reliable.

### TODO
- Chrome
	- Wait for the CIS team to lmk how to query the database. Or, if they won't let me, figure out how to scrape info off CIS site.
- Firefox
	- All of it.
